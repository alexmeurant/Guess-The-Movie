# Guess-The-Movie
A game where the player gets to guess the movie name given the number of letters in it.

The rules are simple, the computer randomly picks a movie title, and shows you how many letters it's made up of. Your goal is to try to figure out the movie by guessing one letter at a time.

If a letter is indeed in the title the computer will reveal its correct position in the word, if not, you lose a point. If you lose 10 points, game over!

BUT the more correct letters you guess the more obvious the movie becomes and at a certain point you should be able to figure it out.
The program will randomly pick a movie title from a text file that contains a large list of movies.
